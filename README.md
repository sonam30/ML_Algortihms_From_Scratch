# Machine Learning Algorithm from Scratch 

The repository contains the implementation of Various Machine Learning algorithms from Scratch. 

- To understand the inner working of algorithm.
- Later on, we can add new features to an algorithm or experiment with different variations of the core idea.

The List of ALgorithms Implemented so far:

**Regression Techniques**

- Linear Regression
**Classification Techniques**

- Logistic Regression

**Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**

- Principal Component Analysis
